# DNA → Protein Translator 🧬

A Python-based bioinformatics tool that translates DNA sequences into RNA and protein sequences using the central dogma of molecular biology.

## Features
- Converts DNA sequences to RNA
- Translates DNA codons into amino acids
- Stops translation at stop codons
- Modular and reusable code structure

## Biological relevance
DNA-to-protein translation is a fundamental biological process. Computational translation is widely used in bioinformatics, variant analysis, protein prediction, and as a preprocessing step in computational biology workflows.

## How to run
```bash
python sample_sequences.py
